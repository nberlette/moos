# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in the
**moos** project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing patience with newcomers and those learning the stack.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, pull
requests, discussions, release communications, and community channels) and also
applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public
spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to **nick@berlette.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly, and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to
respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when determining the
consequences of an action:

1. **Correction** — Communicate why the behavior was inappropriate and request a
   change. No public action is taken.
2. **Warning** — A private warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
   interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction, is
   allowed for a specified period.
3. **Temporary Ban** — Removal from the community and associated channels for a
   defined period.
4. **Permanent Ban** — A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction
   within the community.
